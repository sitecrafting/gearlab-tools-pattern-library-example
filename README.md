# GearLab Tool Pattern Library Example

A simplistic example site consuming the [GearLab Tools Pattern Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gearlab-tools-pattern-library).

## Getting Started

The goal of this repo is simply to demonstrate the usage of the Pattern Library, so the best way to get started is to start the example site and tinker with the app.js to pull in more Pattern Library components to get a sense of how they work.

Start by installing dependencies:

```
yarn
```

Then start the local dev server:

```
yarn start
```

In addition to starting a simple Express.js server, this will watch your example files for changes and rebuild automatically as necessary.
